            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since the 1950s, defined as a machine's ability to perform tasks that would previously require human intelligence. Intelligence is essential to the human experience, and today's AI systems may demonstrate traits of human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, perception, and creativity. AI comes in various forms, such as smart speakers with built-in voice assistants and popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT. These systems can adapt and learn new skills for tasks they weren't explicitly programmed to perform. AI can be divided into three subcategories: narrow AI (ANI), general AI (AGI), and super AI (ASI). ANI is crucial for voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, while AGI involves machines understanding and performing vastly different tasks based on their accumulated experience. ASI is a hypothetical concept where a machine's intelligence surpasses all forms of human intelligence and outperforms humans in every function. Understanding the impact of AI on human life and future generations is crucial for ensuring its continued development and use. Twente, a Canadian company, has built the first 3D printed home in 2020. They have collaborated with World Housing to 3D print a small community near Nelson, B.C., consisting of five similar homes. The high-speed building strategy has also been used to rebuild a devastated community in Merritt, B.C., after 2021's devastating fires and floods.</p>

            <p>3D printing could revolutionize global supply chains by eliminating bottlenecks and allowing for on-demand manufacturing. The technology works by building parts from scratch, reducing waste and reducing material and weight. This has led to a strong foothold in the aerospace industry, where every gram saved equals fuel saved. The Airbus A350 has over 1,000 3D-printed parts, and SpaceX has used the technology to build mission-critical components for spacecraft. The combustion chamber of SpaceX's SuperDraco rocket engine was fabricated entirely with 3D printing, using Inconel, a strong metal superalloy. This technology also allows for a dense network of intricate cooling channels, resulting in massive time savings and fewer parts. The industry is poised for exponential growth, with a forecast of reaching $100 billion by 2028. Anubis 3D showcases a component with multiple, interconnected, moving parts that can rotate out of the machine.</p>

            <p>Robotics is the engineering branch that deals with the conception, design, construction, operation, application, and usage of robots. They are automatically operated machines that carry out a series of actions independently and perform tasks usually accomplished by a human. Some robots, such as "androids," resemble humans to make people feel more at ease around them. Robots are versatile machines with a wide variety of forms and functions, including healthcare, homelife, manufacturing, logistics, space exploration, military, entertainment, and travel.</p>

            <p>Cloud computing is a platform that enables quick deployment and scaling of applications and systems. It is primarily self-service, with most customers using public cloud services hosted in remote data centers. SaaS (software as a service) provides prebuilt applications to customers, while IaaS (infrastructure as a service) offers vast, virtualized compute, storage, and network infrastructure for customers to build their own applications. Big IaaS providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure offer a range of services beyond infrastructure, including developer tools, serverless computing, machine learning services, and data warehouses. Both SaaS and IaaS offer agility, allowing customers to quickly gain new capabilities without capital investment in hardware or software, and scale cloud resources as needed.</p>
