            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since the 1950s, defined as a machine's ability to perform tasks that would previously require human intelligence. Intelligence is essential to the human experience, and today's AI systems may demonstrate traits of human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, perception, and creativity. AI comes in various forms, such as smart speakers with built-in voice assistants and popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT. These systems can adapt and learn new skills for tasks they weren't explicitly programmed to perform. AI can be divided into three subcategories: narrow AI (ANI), general AI (AGI), and super AI (ASI). ANI is crucial for voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, while AGI involves machines understanding and performing vastly different tasks based on their accumulated experience. ASI is a hypothetical concept where a machine's intelligence surpasses all forms of human intelligence and outperforms humans in every function. Understanding the impact of AI on human life and future generations is crucial for ensuring its continued development and use.</p>
